Hey there! Welcome to Sage - your friendly neighborhood Git companion. Think of it as a smart wrapper around Git that helps you streamline your workflow.

## Why Did I Build This? ðŸ¤”

Let's be real - Git is powerful, but sometimes its workflow can be streamlined. I built this because:
- I wanted to automate repetitive Git workflows
- Switching contexts between terminal and browser for PR management was tedious
- Merge conflicts were taking up too much of my day
- I knew there had to be a faster way to handle common Git tasks

So I built Sage to make my life easier, and hopefully yours too!

## What Makes Sage Cool? âœ¨

* **Workflow Automation**: Sage handles common Git operations with smart defaults and built-in best practices.
* **Simple Commands**: Instead of typing `git checkout -b feature/branch && git pull origin main && git push -u origin feature/branch`, just do `sage start feature/branch`. Your fingers will thank you.
* **Smart Recovery**: `sage undo` gives you a clean way to reverse your last operation.
* **PR Magic**: Create and manage pull requests right from your terminal. No more context-switching to GitHub!
* **Your Tool, Your Rules**: Customize Sage to work how you want. Because everyone has their preferred Git workflow.

## Getting Started

1. Install Go (1.20+ recommended).
2. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crazywolf132/sage.git
cd sage
```

3. Build:

```bash
go build -o sage
```

4. Install Sage to your PATH (optional, for convenience):

```bash
go install
```

5. Check it:

```bash
sage --help
sage version
```

## Basic Usage ðŸš€

### Start a new branch

```bash
sage start feature/awesome-stuff
```
Boom! New branch created, latest updates pulled, and pushed to GitHub. All in one go.

### Commit your masterpiece

```bash
sage commit "Add that thing that does the stuff"
```
Stages and commits everything. No more `git add .` followed by `git commit -m` dance.

### Push it real good

```bash
sage push
```
Pushes your work to origin. If you need --force, Sage will make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot.

### Undo that thing you just did

```bash
sage undo
```
We all make mistakes. This one's got your back.

### PR stuff made easy

```bash
# Create a PR
sage pr create --title "ðŸš€ Add awesome feature" --body "Trust me, this is good"

# See what's cooking
sage pr list --state open

# Check out someone's PR
sage pr checkout 42

# Merge it in
sage pr merge 42 --method squash
```

## Command Guide ðŸ“–

Here's a complete guide to Sage's commands:

### Branch Management

```bash
# Create a new branch from default branch (usually main)
sage start <branch-name>

# Sync current branch with default branch
sage sync

# View current branch status
sage status

# Clean up merged branches
sage clean
```

### Changes & Commits

```bash
# Stage and commit changes (excluding .sage/ by default)
sage commit "<message>"

# Stage and commit with conventional commit format
sage commit -c

# Use AI to generate commit message based on changes
sage commit --ai

# Push changes to remote
sage push

# Undo last operation (commit, merge, etc)
sage undo

# Squash commits interactively
sage squash
```

### Pull Request Operations

```bash
# Create a new PR
sage pr create --title "<title>" --body "<description>"

# List pull requests
sage pr list [--state open|closed|all]

# Check out a PR locally
sage pr checkout <pr-number>

# View PR status
sage pr status [pr-number]

# Update PR fields
sage pr update [pr-number] [--title "<title>"] [--body "<body>"] [--draft] [--labels label1,label2] [--reviewers user1,user2]

# Update PR with AI-generated content
sage pr update --ai

# Merge a PR
sage pr merge <pr-number> [--method merge|squash|rebase]

# Close a PR without merging
sage pr close <pr-number>

# List PR review comments and TODOs
sage pr todos [pr-number]
```

### Configuration

```bash
# View current configuration
sage config

# Set configuration values
sage config set <key> <value>

# Common config options:
# - defaultBranch: Your main branch name (default: main)
# - defaultMergeMethod: Preferred PR merge method (default: merge)
# - conventionalCommits: Use conventional commit format (default: false)
# - aiCommits: Use AI for commit messages (default: false)
```

### Other Commands

```bash
# Check Sage version
sage version

# View help for any command
sage help [command]

# View detailed help for a specific command
sage <command> --help
```

### Environment Variables

- `SAGE_GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token
- `SAGE_CONFIG`: Custom config file location
- `SAGE_OPENAI_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI features

### Notes

- The `.sage/` directory is excluded from commits by default unless explicitly staged
- Use `git add -f .sage/` to force include the `.sage/` directory in commits
- AI features require an OpenAI API key to be set

## Future Growth

Even though I'm just one person maintaining this right now, I see a lot of potential for Sage:

* **More Git Host Support**: Integrations with GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted Git services.
* **Enhanced Undo**: A detailed operation log to revert more than just the last commit or merge.
* **Interactive Conflict Resolution**: Potential for a TUI or guided conflict resolution flow.
* **Plugin System**: Let teams extend Sage with custom commands or checks.
* **Optional Lint/Checks**: Pre-commit hooks, code checks, or commit message style enforcement.

I hope to grow this into a stable, community-driven project where developers can feel more confident in their daily workflows.

## Contributing & Feedback

I welcome all issues, ideas, and pull requests. If you run into a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue. This project is something I work on in my spare time, so replies may not be immediateâ€”but I'll do my best to keep up.

Some ways you can help:

* **Open an Issue**: Report bugs or suggest improvements.
* **Submit a Pull Request**: If you fix something or add a feature, I'd love to see it.
* **Share Your Workflow**: Hearing how you use Sage (or what's blocking you) helps guide development.
